We are using the textbook by Smith, Stanley A., et al. *Algebra 2 with Trigonometry.* Prentice Hall, 2006. 

This class began on October 21st, 2021. I was asked to take over teaching a student for the remainder of the year. As such, we don't begin at the start of the year. Some topics (slope, graphing lines, etc.) are assumed to be familiar already. The first two quizzes were designed mainly as a review of material already covered in the begining of the class (Quiz 0.1), and to introduce notation and concepts that I deemed useful (Quiz 0).
