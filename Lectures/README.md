- #### Lecture 1 - Functions
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/2jc2kaafnM8)
  - We define what a function is in general and give an example of a function with which most people are already familiar. 
  - Domain, range, and the inverse of a function are defined and explored in the example.
- #### Lecture 2 - Functions
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/IGcAJ0ljjfo)
  - Why we can't "divide by zero" 
  - Introducing the functions Dom(f) and Ran(f) 
  - Refining our definitions of domain and range
  - Using graphs of functions to determine domain and range
- #### Lecture 3 - Functions and Lines
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/AJ6wJL2BZwY)
  - Review domain and range
  - Introduce restricted/defined domains 
  - Lines as functions and why y=mx + b is all we need
  - Finding equations of lines given 1.) slope & a point and 2.) two points
  - How to compute an inverse function 
- #### Lecture 3.1 - Supplemental Material
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/LZ1XXlfsjLA)
  - Proof that our method is equivalent to the two point formula
  - Examples of finding the equation of a line given two points
- #### Lecture 4 - Inverse Functions and Perpendicular Slopes
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/7Os-yMh1gm4)
  - Review composition of functions
  - Checking an inverse by composition 
  - Perpendicular slopes
- #### Lecture 5 - Intro to Systems of Equations
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/GDsJ_sWwYjs)
  - Observations about equations and operations with equations
  - In this lecture we use reasoning to lead us to a general method for solving systems of linear equations (to be discussed later). Our goal is to see that the method we're going to develop is on solid footing, that we can justify it, and that we believe the steps we'll be taking. 
- #### Lecture 6 - Solving Systems of Equations
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/mt8U13GOb9U)
  - General method for solving systems of linear equations
  - Introduce augmented matrices 
  - Reduced row echelon form and back substitution 
- #### Lecture 6.1 - Worked Examples
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/s9fKdGApGls) 
  - We solve 3 systems of equations:
    - 3 equations with 3 unknowns (without fractions)
    - 3 equations with 3 unknowns (with fractions)
    - 4 equations with 4 unknowns
