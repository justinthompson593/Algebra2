- #### Lecture 1 - Functions
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/2jc2kaafnM8)
  - We define what a function is in general and give an example of a function with which most people are already familiar. 
  - Domain, range, and the inverse of a function are defined and explored in the example.
- #### Lecture 2 - Functions

  - Review domain and range
  - Introduce restricted/defined domains 
  - Lines as functions and why y=mx + b is all we need
  - Finding equations of lines given 1.) slope & a point and 2.) two points
  - How to compute an inverse function

  - In this lecture we use reasoning to lead us to a general method for solving systems of linear equations (to be discussed later). Our goal is to see that the method we're going to develop is on solid footing, that we can justify it, and that we believe the steps we'll be taking.
