- ### Lecture 1 - Functions
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/2jc2kaafnM8)
  - We define what a function is in general and give an intuitive example of a function with which most people are already familiar. 
  - Domain, range, and the inverse of a function are defined and explored in the example.
- ### Lecture 2 - Functions
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/IGcAJ0ljjfo)
  - Why we can't "divide by zero" 
  - Introducing the functions Dom(f) and Ran(f) 
  - Refining our definitions of domain and range
  - Using graphs of functions to determine domain and range
- ### Lecture 3 - Functions and Lines
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/2xZCoBxb9uI)
  - Review domain and range
  - Introduce restricted/defined domains 
  - Lines as functions and why y=mx + b is all we need
  - Finding equations of lines given 1.) slope & a point and 2.) two points
  - How to compute an inverse function
